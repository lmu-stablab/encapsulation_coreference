# Encapsulation and Coreference 

This repository contains the statistical analyses conducted for the study "*Cognitive Processing of nominal anaphoric Encapsulation and Coreference in native Spanish Speakers: an experimental Approach with Eye-Tracking*".

To ensure the successful execution of the scripts, a specific folder structure is required. The raw data should be stored in `0_data/1_raw_data`. The data preparation is carried out by running `description.R` first. Once the data has been preprocessed, the main statistical analysis can be performed using `analysis.R`.
